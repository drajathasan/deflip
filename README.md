# deflip

We thank you to Mas @heroesoebekti for his initial effort in creating the wonderful plugin for SLiMS 9 Bulian called dflip. The plugin was created to make a flipbook reader in SLiMS 9 Bulian. Since a flipbook mode reader can be an eye-catching mode to reader, as if they read on a physical book.

After a while, we need to increase the pace of the game for this plugin. This latest plugin is not just a repackage plugin based on the first plugin created by Mas @heroesoebekti. But we made some improvements to this plugin instead of just repackaging it. Those improvements are:
